LOAD DATA INTO SPARKSEE
=================================================
1) Create an Sparksee script to load the data from CSVs. Check http://www.sparsity-technologies.com/UserManual/Scripting.html
2) You must be in the same directory whether you have the sparksee database file (check  $GREMLIN_SERVER_HOME/conf/sparksee-empty.properties).
3) Then run the command "sparksee-script.sh {your script} .utf8"


FYI: You could see an example of script that appears in the doc/examples/db-loader.ddl
