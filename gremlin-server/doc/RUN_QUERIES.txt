RUN QUERIES INTO SPARKSEE
=================================================
1) Run from wherever you want the sqlline command.
2) Inside the sqlline type: !connect jdbc:sparksee://localhost:8182
3) Press enter when the system asks for user and password.
4) Run an algebra query. Example: GRAPH::SCAN('Person');
5) To quit the system, type !quit


FYI: The syntax of graph queries are specified into the doc/Sparksee_Algebra.doc. Have fun :) !
